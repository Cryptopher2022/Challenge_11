# Challenge_11
Initial - Interim upload - Unfinished work - Bare README file

I got stuck on Part 4 and started and restarted again and again.  
I'm embarrased to turn this in but thought it best I turn something in.  
I am not finished and I will complete the Challenge.  I will continue
working on it tomorrow until it's done and done right.  I appreciate
your patience.  As a point of reference, I worked all week to get through the material
which I believe I have a very good handle on.  I understand the concepts
and I know what I'm trying to do.  I'm just having a devil of a time getting
the right syntax to do what I want.
